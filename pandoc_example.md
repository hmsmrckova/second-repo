Block Quotes
============

We simply italicize them and don't do any fancy quote bar or decoration 
since they are already indented on the left and right.

> We simply italicize them and don't do any fancy quote bar or decoration 
since they are already indented on the left and right.


Code
====

Code blocks are styled more to be set apart a bit more than just the monospaced 
font. A light background color and border (in case the background doesn't print, 
but it looks nice too).

	x = e * 10 / 2;
	y = p - 7;

On screen, the blocks provide scroll boxes and the `inline code spans` 
word wrap. For print, the code blocks also change to word wrap. On screen, the 
`code spans` also get a little border, but lose it in print.

Links
=====

Remove the underline except on hover. When printing, remove all styling and 
print external URLs after the link text to be useful in a printout. There is no 
filter to not print very long URLs though.

A link to [Google][]. A simple link to <http://wikipedia.org>.

I haven't figured out how to not redundantly print the URL after a simple link 
whose link text is the URL.

[Google]: http://www.google.com

Horizontal rule
===============

A thin line that doesn't have that shadow thing that looks terrible, especially 
in print.

See the end for what footnotes looks like[^1].

[^1]: A double-line rule with the word "NOTES" in the center.

Definition Lists
================

Still may tweak this. Trying to use subtle lines to help group it, but it feels 
a bit too table-like. However, without them, it doesn't seem to stand out much.

Term

:   Definition of the term

Term2

:   First definition of Term2
    It can be a long, wrapped paragraph like this.
    
    A definition can include multiple paragraphs if they are indented
    the same in Pandoc and MultiMarkdown 3. MultiMarkdown 2 doesn't
    support this, so it will be interpreted there as a code block
    following the Term2 definition.
    
    - They can also include Markdown
    - If it supports multiple paragraphs, a definition can contain lists and things
    - But the first has to start as a regular paragraph

Term3

:   A term can have multiple definitions. 

:   The second definition of Term3. Depending on the stylesheet for HTML
    you are using or the output format (LaTeX, etc.), this second
    definition may appear styled as a separate term but without the term
    itself.


Tables
======

These get more styling than most things, yet it's still very little compared to 
most table stylings, but way better than an un-styled HTML table. It's to emulate 
a simple textbook style, but we throw in a hover row highlight to be a little 
useful on-screen when scrubbing around the table.

  Right     Left     Center     Default

     12     12        12            12
    123     123       123          123
      1     1          1             1
